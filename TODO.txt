TASK: Instead of central difference, use cantera's jacobian method. Then calculate fnn jacobian use back propagation, then add all up. 
1/ Figure out canteras jacobian.
2/ Figure out how to implement back propagation.
3/ fix cantera conda env
4/ maybe do cantera + intel conda env
5/ finish transferring fnn to codejenn
